# [API Reference](https://docs.stripe.com/api)
The Stripe API is organized around . Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts request bodies, returns responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.
You can use the Stripe API in test mode, which doesn’t affect your live data or interact with the banking networks. The API key you use to [authenticate](https://docs.stripe.com/api/authentication) the request determines whether the request is live mode or test mode.
The Stripe API doesn’t support bulk updates. You can work on only one object per request.
The Stripe API differs for every account as we release new [versions](https://docs.stripe.com/api/versioning) and tailor functionality. [Log in](https://dashboard.stripe.com/login?redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.stripe.com%2Fapi) to see docs with your test key and data.
## Just getting started?
Check out our [development quickstart](https://docs.stripe.com/development/quickstart) guide.
## Not a developer?
Use Stripe’s [no-code options](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/no-code) or apps from to get started with Stripe and to do more with your Stripe account—no code required.

Client Libraries
RubyPythonPHPJavaNode.jsGo.NET
By default, the Stripe API Docs demonstrate using curl to interact with the API over HTTP. Select one of our official [client libraries](https://docs.stripe.com/libraries) to see examples in code.
# [Authentication](https://docs.stripe.com/api/authentication)
The Stripe API uses [API keys](https://docs.stripe.com/keys) to authenticate requests. You can view and manage your API keys in [the Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/login?redirect=/apikeys).
Test mode secret keys have the prefix `sk_test_` and live mode secret keys have the prefix `sk_live_`. Alternatively, you can use [restricted API keys](https://docs.stripe.com/keys#limit-access) for granular permissions.
Your API keys carry many privileges, so be sure to keep them secure! Do not share your secret API keys in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, and so forth.
All API requests must be made over . Calls made over plain HTTP will fail. API requests without authentication will also fail.
Authenticated Request
Server-side language
cURLStripe CLIRubyPythonPHPJavaNode.jsGo.NET
```

curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/charges \
 -u sk_test_BQokikJ...2HlWgH4olfQ2sk_test_BQokikJOvBiI2HlWgH4olfQ2:
# The colon prevents curl from asking for a password.

```

Your API Key
A sample test API key is included in all the examples here, so you can test any example right away. Do not submit any personally identifiable information in requests made with this key.
To test requests using your account, replace the sample API key with your actual API key or [sign in](https://dashboard.stripe.com/login?redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.stripe.com%2Fapi).
# [Connected Accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/api/connected-accounts)
To act as connected accounts, clients can issue requests using the `Stripe-Account` special header. Make sure that this header contains a Stripe account ID, which usually starts with the `acct_` prefix.
The value is set per-request as shown in the adjacent code sample. Methods on the returned object reuse the same account ID.

# [Errors](https://docs.stripe.com/api/errors)
Stripe uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. In general: Codes in the `2xx` range indicate success. Codes in the `4xx` range indicate an error that failed given the information provided (e.g., a required parameter was omitted, a charge failed, etc.). Codes in the `5xx` range indicate an error with Stripe’s servers (these are rare).
Some `4xx` errors that could be handled programmatically (e.g., a card is [declined](https://docs.stripe.com/declines)) include an [error code](https://docs.stripe.com/error-codes) that briefly explains the error reported.
### Attributes

HTTP Status Code Summary
200| OK| Everything worked as expected.  
---|---|---  
400| Bad Request| The request was unacceptable, often due to missing a required parameter.  
401| Unauthorized| No valid API key provided.  
402| Request Failed| The parameters were valid but the request failed.  
403| Forbidden| The API key doesn’t have permissions to perform the request.  
404| Not Found| The requested resource doesn’t exist.  
409| Conflict| The request conflicts with another request (perhaps due to using the same idempotent key).  
429| Too Many Requests| Too many requests hit the API too quickly. We recommend an exponential backoff of your requests.  
500, 502, 503, 504| Server Errors| Something went wrong on Stripe’s end. (These are rare.)  
Error Types
`api_error`| API errors cover any other type of problem (e.g., a temporary problem with Stripe’s servers), and are extremely uncommon.  
---|---  
`card_error`| Card errors are the most common type of error you should expect to handle. They result when the user enters a card that can’t be charged for some reason.  
`idempotency_error`| Idempotency errors occur when an `Idempotency-Key` is re-used on a request that does not match the first request’s API endpoint and parameters.  
`invalid_request_error`| Invalid request errors arise when your request has invalid parameters.  
# [Handling errors](https://docs.stripe.com/api/errors/handling)
Our Client libraries raise exceptions for many reasons, such as a failed charge, invalid parameters, authentication errors, and network unavailability. We recommend writing code that gracefully handles all possible API exceptions.

# [Expanding Responses](https://docs.stripe.com/api/expanding_objects)
Many objects allow you to request additional information as an expanded response by using the `expand` request parameter. This parameter is available on all API requests, and applies to the response of that request only. You can expand responses in two ways.
In many cases, an object contains the ID of a related object in its response properties. For example, a `Charge` might have an associated Customer ID. You can expand these objects in line with the expand request parameter. The `expandable` label in this documentation indicates ID fields that you can expand into objects.
Some available fields aren’t included in the responses by default, such as the `number` and `cvc` fields for the Issuing Card object. You can request these fields as an expanded response by using the `expand` request parameter.
You can expand recursively by specifying nested fields after a dot (`.`). For example, requesting `payment_intent.customer` on a charge expands the `payment_intent` property into a full Customer object, then expands the `customer` property on that payment intent into a full Customer object.
You can use the `expand` parameter on any endpoint that returns expandable fields, including list, create, and update endpoints.
Expansions on list requests start with the `data` property. For example, you can expand `data.customers` on a request to list charges and associated customers. Performing deep expansions on numerous list requests might result in slower processing times.
Expansions have a maximum depth of four levels (for example, the deepest expansion allowed when listing charges is `data.payment_intent.customer.default_source`).
You can expand multiple objects at the same time by identifying multiple items in the `expand` array.

# [Idempotent requests](https://docs.stripe.com/api/idempotent_requests)
The API supports for safely retrying requests without accidentally performing the same operation twice. When creating or updating an object, use an idempotency key. Then, if a connection error occurs, you can safely repeat the request without risk of creating a second object or performing the update twice.
To perform an idempotent request, provide an additional `IdempotencyKey` element to the request options.
Stripe’s idempotency works by saving the resulting status code and body of the first request made for any given idempotency key, regardless of whether it succeeds or fails. Subsequent requests with the same key return the same result, including `500` errors.
A client generates an idempotency key, which is a unique key that the server uses to recognize subsequent retries of the same request. How you create unique keys is up to you, but we suggest using V4 UUIDs, or another random string with enough entropy to avoid collisions. Idempotency keys are up to 255 characters long.
You can remove keys from the system automatically after they’re at least 24 hours old. We generate a new request if a key is reused after the original is pruned. The idempotency layer compares incoming parameters to those of the original request and errors if they’re not the same to prevent accidental misuse.
We save results only after the execution of an endpoint begins. If incoming parameters fail validation, or the request conflicts with another request that’s executing concurrently, we don’t save the idempotent result because no API endpoint initiates the execution. You can retry these requests. Learn more about when you can [retry idempotent requests](https://docs.stripe.com/error-low-level#idempotency).
All `POST` requests accept idempotency keys. Don’t send idempotency keys in `GET` and `DELETE` requests because it has no effect. These requests are idempotent by definition.

# [Metadata](https://docs.stripe.com/api/metadata)
Updateable Stripe objects—including [Account](https://docs.stripe.com/api/accounts), [Charge](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges), [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers), [PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents), [Refund](https://docs.stripe.com/api/refunds), [Subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions), and [Transfer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/transfers) have a `metadata` parameter. You can use this parameter to attach key-value data to these Stripe objects.
You can specify up to 50 keys, with key names up to 40 characters long and values up to 500 characters long. Keys and values are stored as strings and can contain any characters with one exception: you can’t use square brackets ([ and ]) in keys.
You can use metadata to store additional, structured information on an object. For example, you could store your user’s full name and corresponding unique identifier from your system on a Stripe [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers) object. Stripe doesn’t use metadata—for example, we don’t use it to authorize or decline a charge and it won’t be seen by your users unless you choose to show it to them.
Some of the objects listed above also support a `description` parameter. You can use the `description` parameter to annotate a charge-for example, a human-readable description such as `2 shirts for test@example.com`. Unlike `metadata`, `description` is a single string, which your users might see (for example, in email receipts Stripe sends on your behalf).
Don’t store any sensitive information (bank account numbers, card details, and so on) as metadata or in the `description` parameter.
  * Related guide: [Metadata](https://docs.stripe.com/metadata)


## Sample metadata use cases
  * **Link IDs** : Attach your system’s unique IDs to a Stripe object to simplify lookups. For example, add your order number to a charge, your user ID to a customer or recipient, or a unique receipt number to a transfer.
  * **Refund papertrails** : Store information about the reason for a refund and the individual responsible for its creation.
  * **Customer details** : Annotate a customer by storing an internal ID for your future use.

# [Pagination](https://docs.stripe.com/api/pagination)
All top-level API resources have support for bulk fetches through “list” API methods. For example, you can [list charges](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges/list), [list customers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/list), and [list invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/list). These list API methods share a common structure and accept, at a minimum, the following three parameters: `limit`, `starting_after`, and `ending_before`.
Stripe’s list API methods use cursor-based pagination through the `starting_after` and `ending_before` parameters. Both parameters accept an existing object ID value (see below) and return objects in reverse chronological order. The `ending_before` parameter returns objects listed before the named object. The `starting_after` parameter returns objects listed after the named object. These parameters are mutually exclusive. You can use either the `starting_after` or `ending_before` parameter, but not both simultaneously.
Our client libraries offer [auto-pagination helpers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/pagination/auto) to traverse all pages of a list.
### Parameters
  * #### 
limitoptional, default is 10
This specifies a limit on the number of objects to return, ranging between 1 and 100.
  * #### 
starting_afteroptional object ID
A cursor to use in pagination. `starting_after` is an object ID that defines your place in the list. For example, if you make a list request and receive 100 objects, ending with `obj_foo`, your subsequent call can include `starting_after=obj_foo` to fetch the next page of the list.
  * #### 
ending_beforeoptional object ID
A cursor to use in pagination. `ending_before` is an object ID that defines your place in the list. For example, if you make a list request and receive 100 objects, starting with `obj_bar`, your subsequent call can include `ending_before=obj_bar` to fetch the previous page of the list.

# [Search](https://docs.stripe.com/api/pagination/search)
Some top-level API resource have support for retrieval via “search” API methods. For example, you can [search charges](https://docs.stripe.com/api/charges/search), [search customers](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/search), and [search subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions/search).
Stripe’s search API methods utilize cursor-based pagination via the `page` request parameter and `next_page` response parameter. For example, if you make a search request and receive `"next_page": "pagination_key"` in the response, your subsequent call can include `page=pagination_key` to fetch the next page of results.
Our client libraries offer [auto-pagination](https://docs.stripe.com/api/pagination/auto) helpers to easily traverse all pages of a search result.
### Search request format
  * #### 
queryrequired
The search query string. See [search query language](https://docs.stripe.com/search#search-query-language).
  * #### 
limitoptional
A limit on the number of objects returned. Limit can range between 1 and 100, and the default is 10.
  * #### 
pageoptional
A cursor for pagination across multiple pages of results. Don’t include this parameter on the first call. Use the `next_page` value returned in a previous response to request subsequent results.


### Search response format
  * #### 
objectstring, value is "search_result"
A string describing the object type returned.
  * #### 
urlstring
The URL for accessing this list.
  * #### 
has_moreboolean
Whether or not there are more elements available after this set. If `false`, this set comprises the end of the list.
  * #### 
dataarray
An array containing the actual response elements, paginated by any request parameters.
  * #### 
next_pagestring
A cursor for use in pagination. If `has_more` is true, you can pass the value of `next_page` to a subsequent call to fetch the next page of results.
  * #### 
total_countoptional positive integer or zero
The total number of objects that match the query, only accurate up to 10,000. This field isn’t included by default. To include it in the response, [expand](https://docs.stripe.com/api/expanding_objects) the `total_count` field.

# [Request IDs](https://docs.stripe.com/api/request_ids)
Each API request has an associated request identifier. You can find this value in the response headers, under `Request-Id`. You can also find request identifiers in the URLs of individual request logs in your [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/logs).
To expedite the resolution process, provide the request identifier when you contact us about a specific request.

# [Versioning](https://docs.stripe.com/api/versioning)
Each major release, such as [Acacia](https://docs.stripe.com/changelog/acacia), includes changes that aren’t [backward-compatible](https://docs.stripe.com/upgrades#what-changes-does-stripe-consider-to-be-backward-compatible) with previous releases. Upgrading to a new major release can require updates to existing code. Each monthly release includes only backward-compatible changes, and uses the same name as the last major release. You can safely upgrade to a new monthly release without breaking any existing code. The current version is 2025-04-30.basil. For information on all API versions, view our [API changelog](https://docs.stripe.com/changelog).
You can upgrade your API version in [Workbench](https://dashboard.stripe.com/workbench). As a precaution, use API versioning to test a new API version before committing to an upgrade.

# [Balance](https://docs.stripe.com/api/balance)
This is an object representing your Stripe balance. You can retrieve it to see the balance currently on your Stripe account.
You can also retrieve the balance history, which contains a list of [transactions](https://docs.stripe.com/reporting/balance-transaction-types) that contributed to the balance (charges, payouts, and so forth).
The available and pending amounts for each currency are broken down further by payment source types.

# [Events](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events)
Events are our way of letting you know when something interesting happens in your account. When an interesting event occurs, we create a new `Event` object. For example, when a charge succeeds, we create a `charge.succeeded` event, and when an invoice payment attempt fails, we create an `invoice.payment_failed` event. Certain API requests might create multiple events. For example, if you create a new subscription for a customer, you receive both a `customer.subscription.created` event and a `charge.succeeded` event.
Events occur when the state of another API resource changes. The event’s data field embeds the resource’s state at the time of the change. For example, a `charge.succeeded` event contains a charge, and an `invoice.payment_failed` event contains an invoice.
As with other API resources, you can use endpoints to retrieve an [individual event](https://docs.stripe.com/api#retrieve_event) or a [list of events](https://docs.stripe.com/api#list_events) from the API. We also have a separate system for sending the `Event` objects directly to an endpoint on your server. You can manage webhooks in your [account settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/webhooks). Learn how to [listen for events](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks) so that your integration can automatically trigger reactions.
When using [Connect](https://docs.stripe.com/connect), you can also receive event notifications that occur in connected accounts. For these events, there’s an additional `account` attribute in the received `Event` object.
We only guarantee access to events through the [Retrieve Event API](https://docs.stripe.com/api#retrieve_event) for 30 days.

# [Setup Intents](https://docs.stripe.com/api/setup_intents)
A SetupIntent guides you through the process of setting up and saving a customer’s payment credentials for future payments. For example, you can use a SetupIntent to set up and save your customer’s card without immediately collecting a payment. Later, you can use [PaymentIntents](https://docs.stripe.com/api#payment_intents) to drive the payment flow.
Create a SetupIntent when you’re ready to collect your customer’s payment credentials. Don’t maintain long-lived, unconfirmed SetupIntents because they might not be valid. The SetupIntent transitions through multiple [statuses](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/intents#intent-statuses) as it guides you through the setup process.
Successful SetupIntents result in payment credentials that are optimized for future payments. For example, cardholders in [certain regions](https://stripe.com/guides/strong-customer-authentication) might need to be run through [Strong Customer Authentication](https://docs.stripe.com/strong-customer-authentication) during payment method collection to streamline later [off-session payments](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/setup-intents). If you use the SetupIntent with a [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api#setup_intent_object-customer), it automatically attaches the resulting payment method to that Customer after successful setup. We recommend using SetupIntents or [setup_future_usage](https://docs.stripe.com/api#payment_intent_object-setup_future_usage) on PaymentIntents to save payment methods to prevent saving invalid or unoptimized payment methods.
By using SetupIntents, you can reduce friction for your customers, even as regulations change over time.

# [Tokens](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tokens)
Tokenization is the process Stripe uses to collect sensitive card or bank account details, or personally identifiable information (PII), directly from your customers in a secure manner. A token representing this information is returned to your server to use. Use our [recommended payments integrations](https://docs.stripe.com/payments) to perform this process on the client-side. This guarantees that no sensitive card data touches your server, and allows your integration to operate in a PCI-compliant way.
If you can’t use client-side tokenization, you can also create tokens using the API with either your publishable or secret API key. If your integration uses this method, you’re responsible for any PCI compliance that it might require, and you must keep your secret API key safe. Unlike with client-side tokenization, your customer’s information isn’t sent directly to Stripe, so we can’t determine how it’s handled or stored.
You can’t store or use tokens more than once. To store card or bank account information for later use, create [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api#customers) objects or [External accounts](https://docs.stripe.com/api#external_accounts). [Radar](https://docs.stripe.com/radar), our integrated solution for automatic fraud protection, performs best with integrations that use client-side tokenization.

**Direct** configurations apply to payments created on your account, including Connect destination charges, Connect separate charges and transfers, and payments not involving Connect.
**Child** configurations apply to payments created on your connected accounts using direct charges, and charges with the on_behalf_of parameter.
Child configurations have a `parent` that sets default values and controls which settings connected accounts may override. You can specify a parent ID at payment time, and Stripe will automatically resolve the connected account’s associated child configuration. Parent configurations are [managed in the dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods/connected_accounts) and are not available in this API.

# [Prices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices)
Prices define the unit cost, currency, and (optional) billing cycle for both recurring and one-time purchases of products. [Products](https://docs.stripe.com/api#products) help you track inventory or provisioning, and prices help you track payment terms. Different physical goods or levels of service should be represented by products, and pricing options should be represented by prices. This approach lets you change prices without having to change your provisioning scheme.
For example, you might have a single “gold” product that has prices for $10/month, $100/year, and €9 once.

A portal session describes the instantiation of the customer portal for a particular customer. By visiting the session’s URL, the customer can manage their subscriptions and billing details. For security reasons, sessions are short-lived and will expire if the customer does not visit the URL. Create sessions on-demand when customers intend to manage their subscriptions and billing details.

# [Invoices](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices)
Invoices are statements of amounts owed by a customer, and are either generated one-off, or generated periodically from a subscription.
They contain [invoice items](https://docs.stripe.com/api#invoiceitems), and proration adjustments that may be caused by subscription upgrades/downgrades (if necessary).
If your invoice is configured to be billed through automatic charges, Stripe automatically finalizes your invoice and attempts payment. Note that finalizing the invoice, [when automatic](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/integration/automatic-advancement-collection), does not happen immediately as the invoice is created. Stripe waits until one hour after the last webhook was successfully sent (or the last webhook timed out after failing). If you (and the platforms you may have connected to) have no webhooks configured, Stripe waits one hour after creation to finalize the invoice.
If your invoice is configured to be billed by sending an email, then based on your [email settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/billing/automatic), Stripe will email the invoice to your customer and await payment. These emails can contain a link to a hosted page to pay the invoice.
Stripe applies any customer credit on the account before determining the amount due for the invoice (i.e., the amount that will be actually charged). If the amount due for the invoice is less than Stripe’s [minimum allowed charge per currency](https://docs.stripe.com/currencies#minimum-and-maximum-charge-amounts), the invoice is automatically marked paid, and we add the amount due to the customer’s credit balance which is applied to the next invoice.
More details on the customer’s credit balance are [here](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/customer/balance).

# [Invoice Items](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoiceitems)
Invoice Items represent the component lines of an [invoice](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices). An invoice item is added to an invoice by creating or updating it with an `invoice` field, at which point it will be included as [an invoice line item](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/line_item) within [invoice.lines](https://docs.stripe.com/api/invoices/object#invoice_object-lines).
Invoice Items can be created before you are ready to actually send the invoice. This can be particularly useful when combined with a [subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/api/subscriptions). Sometimes you want to add a charge or credit to a customer, but actually charge or credit the customer’s card only at the end of a regular billing cycle. This is useful for combining several charges (to minimize per-transaction fees), or for having Stripe tabulate your usage-based billing totals.

[Learn more about calling API v2 endpoints. ](https://docs.stripe.com/api-v2-overview)
You can send a higher-throughput of meter events using meter event streams. For this flow, you must first create a meter event session, which will provide you with a session token. You can then create meter events through the meter event stream endpoint, using the session token for authentication. The session tokens are short-lived and you will need to create a new meter event session when the token expires.

# [Meter Event Summary](https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter-event-summary)
A billing meter event summary represents an aggregated view of a customer’s billing meter events within a specified timeframe. It indicates how much usage was accrued by a customer for that period.
Note: Meters events are aggregated asynchronously so the meter event summaries provide an eventually consistent view of the reported usage.

# [Plans](https://docs.stripe.com/api/plans)
You can now model subscriptions more flexibly using the [Prices API](https://docs.stripe.com/api#prices). It replaces the Plans API and is backwards compatible to simplify your migration.
Plans define the base price, currency, and billing cycle for recurring purchases of products. [Products](https://docs.stripe.com/api#products) help you track inventory or provisioning, and plans help you track pricing. Different physical goods or levels of service should be represented by products, and pricing options should be represented by plans. This approach lets you change prices without having to change your provisioning scheme.
For example, you might have a single “gold” product that has plans for $10/month, $100/year, €9/month, and €90/year.

The primary resource in Secret Store is a `secret`. Other apps can’t view secrets created by an app. Additionally, secrets are scoped to provide further permission control.
All Dashboard users and the app backend share `account` scoped secrets. Use the `account` scope for secrets that don’t change per-user, like a third-party API key.
A `user` scoped secret is accessible by the app backend and one specific Dashboard user. Use the `user` scope for per-user secrets like per-user OAuth tokens, where different users might have different permissions.

# [Tax Registrations](https://docs.stripe.com/api/tax/registrations)
A Tax `Registration` lets us know that your business is registered to collect tax on payments within a region, enabling you to [automatically collect tax](https://docs.stripe.com/tax).
Stripe doesn’t register on your behalf with the relevant authorities when you create a Tax `Registration` object. For more information on how to register to collect tax, see [our guide](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/registering).

# [Verification Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_sessions)
A VerificationSession guides you through the process of collecting and verifying the identities of your users. It contains details about the type of verification, such as what [verification check](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/verification-checks) to perform. Only create one VerificationSession for each verification in your system.
A VerificationSession transitions through [multiple statuses](https://docs.stripe.com/identity/how-sessions-work) throughout its lifetime as it progresses through the verification flow. The VerificationSession contains the user’s verified data after verification checks are complete.

# [Verification Report](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_reports)
A VerificationReport is the result of an attempt to collect and verify data from a user. The collection of verification checks performed is determined from the `type` and `options` parameters used. You can find the result of each verification check performed in the appropriate sub-resource: `document`, `id_number`, `selfie`.
Each VerificationReport contains a copy of any data collected by the user as well as reference IDs which can be used to access collected images through the [FileUpload](https://docs.stripe.com/api/files) API. To configure and create VerificationReports, use the [VerificationSession](https://docs.stripe.com/api/identity/verification_sessions) API.

# [Forwarding Request](https://docs.stripe.com/api/forwarding/request)
Instructs Stripe to make a request on your behalf using the destination URL. The destination URL is activated by Stripe at the time of onboarding. Stripe verifies requests with your credentials provided during onboarding, and injects card details from the payment_method into the request.
Stripe redacts all sensitive fields and headers, including authentication credentials and card numbers, before storing the request and response data in the forwarding Request object, which are subject to a 30-day retention period.
You can provide a Stripe idempotency key to make sure that requests with the same key result in only one outbound request. The Stripe idempotency key provided should be unique and different from any idempotency keys provided on the underlying third-party request.
Forwarding Requests are synchronous requests that return a response or time out according to Stripe’s limits.
